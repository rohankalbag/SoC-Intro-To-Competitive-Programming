## Learnings 
- Estimating complexity of the problem before actually starting to solve to maximize success
- Effective usage of C++ STL classes such as `map`, `vector`, `set`, `priority_queue`, `queue`, `stack` in order to reduce implementation time
- Creation of a [generic template code](https://github.com/rohankalbag/Intro-To-Competitive-Programming/blob/main/generic.cpp) for CP competitions to save time during contests
- Exposure to effective problem solving strategies aimed towards competitions hosted online
- Exploring DSA to supplement CP and problem solving ability
